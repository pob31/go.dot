/*
    OSCQUERY SERVERS FOUND ON THE NETWORK (namespace draft §76, ARU, ARW, ASA).

    A thread with one UDP socket on port 5353, shared with the system's own
    responder, joined to 224.0.0.251 on every IPv4 interface: it asks for
    `_oscjson._tcp` - at the start, then after one, two, four... seconds up to
    a minute, and whenever somebody asks (`browse`, from `network.browse`) - and
    keeps what answers: an instance (PTR), its host and port (SRV), its notes
    (TXT), the host's address (A), each until its time to live runs out or a
    goodbye takes it. An instance whose host or port is missing is asked about
    once a second until both come. Complete instances are the list.

    WHAT IS FOUND IS NOT A DECISION (ARW): the list is a sentence a line,
    published as `network/found`, never a command or a line of the log. Picking
    one is the gesture, and that is `mount.describeAt`.

    WHEN 5353 CANNOT BE SHARED (ASA): a port of the system's choosing, the
    question sent to the group with "answer me directly" set (RFC 6762 §6.7),
    every five seconds; `mode` says `unicast`. A test binds no part of 5353:
    its options name port 0 and the responders to ask directly (`peers`).

    LEAVING ITSELF OUT: a service at one of this machine's addresses on
    `ownPort` - Go.dot's own HTTP port - is this Go.dot, not a device.

    THE HANDLER OF EVERYTHING IS THE THREAD: the socket is read and written on
    it alone, the maps are its own, and what anybody else reads - the list, the
    mode, the problem - is copied out under one lock, a revision saying when it
    moved.
