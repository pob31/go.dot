/*
    WHEN A MULTICAST ANSWER MAY GO OUT (RFC 6762 §6 and §7.4). Found the hard
    way on 2026-11-10: the responder answered every question it heard, at once,
    to the group. clap-validator loads the plugin in a couple of hundred
    processes within a second, each one announcing the plugin's server and each
    one answering every other's question, and a machine sent 11,600 multicast
    datagrams in that second. On a phone's hotspot, where multicast goes out at
    the slowest rate, that took the link down. Go.dot is one process per
    machine and cannot flood that way, but it answered the same way: at once,
    to every question, on every interface.

    Three rules, all the RFC's:

      - AN ANSWER WAITS A LITTLE (§6: 20 to 120 ms, chosen at random by the
        caller), so that several responders with the same thing to say do not
        say it in the same instant.
      - WHAT ANOTHER RESPONDER JUST SAID IS NOT SAID AGAIN (§7.4): a record
        heard in somebody's multicast response while ours waits counts as sent.
      - A RECORD IS NOT MULTICAST TWICE WITHIN A SECOND (§6). A querier that
        missed it asks again a second later, as every querier does.

    And one of this library's own, for whatever the three do not foresee: A
    BUDGET of datagrams to the group, ten a second with a burst of twenty,
    spent by answers and questions alike. What is over budget is dropped, and
    mDNS, where everything is repeated, loses nothing by it.

    Pure: no socket and no clock of its own, so the tests drive it with times
    of their choosing. Not thread-safe; the browser's thread owns it.
